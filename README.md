## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo-directory>
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Place the dataset

Download the Medical MNIST zip and extract it into `data/raw/`:

```
data/raw/
├── AbdomenCT/
├── BreastMRI/
├── ChestCT/
├── CXR/
├── Hand/
└── HeadCT/
```

## Usage

### Train all 12 models (1 AE + 1 VAE per region)

```python
from src.data_processing import collect_image_paths, train_val_split, build_all_class_datasets
from src.train import train_all_regions

paths, labels = collect_image_paths("data/raw")
train_paths, train_labels, val_paths, val_labels = train_val_split(paths, labels)
train_ds, val_ds = build_all_class_datasets(train_paths, train_labels, val_paths, val_labels)

ae_models, vae_models, histories = train_all_regions(
    train_ds_map=train_ds,
    val_ds_map=val_ds,
    latent_dim=16,
    epochs=20,
    learning_rate=1e-3,
    kl_weight=0.5,
    models_dir="models/",
)
```

Saved weights are versioned automatically:
```
models/
└── BreastMRI/
    ├── ae_v1.weights.h5
    └── vae_v1.weights.h5
```
A `training_metadata.json` file is written to `models/` with all hyperparameters and wall-clock time for reproducibility.

### Use a trained model

```python
from src.model import Autoencoder, VAE

ae = Autoencoder(latent_dim=16)
ae.load_weights("models/BreastMRI/ae_v1.weights.h5")

reconstruction = ae.reconstruct(images)
latent_codes   = ae.encode(images)
samples        = ae.sample(8)
```

### Inject noise for denoising evaluation

```python
from src.data_processing import add_gaussian_noise

noisy_images   = add_gaussian_noise(images, noise_factor=0.3)
ae_denoised    = ae.reconstruct(noisy_images)
```

## Running Tests

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```
